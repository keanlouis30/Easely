    <h1>Terms of Use for Easely</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: August 26, 2025</p>

    <p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully before using the Easely chatbot on the Facebook Messenger platform (the "Service") operated by [Your Name/Project Name] ("we," "us," or "our").</p>
    <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all users and others who access or use the Service.</p>
    <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Easely is a chatbot that connects to a user's Canvas LMS account to provide academic task management, reminders, and AI-powered assistance. The Service offers a "Free Tier" with limited features and a paid "Premium Tier" with expanded features.</p>

    <h2>2. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Canvas Access Token:</strong> You are solely responsible for generating your Canvas Access Token and for its security. You agree not to share your token with any unauthorized parties. You grant Easely permission to use this token to access your Canvas data as described in our Privacy Policy to provide the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>Accurate Information:</strong> You agree to provide accurate and complete information when using the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> The AI-powered features (e.g., "AI Outline Generation") are intended to be used as study aids and assistance tools, not as a means to commit academic dishonesty. You are solely responsible for the originality and integrity of your own academic work. Misuse of these tools in violation of your institution's academic integrity policy is your responsibility. Easely is not liable for any academic penalties you may incur.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Premium Tier:</strong> Access to the Premium Tier is provided as a 30-day, non-recurring "Access Pass." It is not an automatically renewing subscription. You must manually renew your access.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> All payments are processed through a third-party service (Ko-fi/Stripe). We are not responsible for any issues or errors arising from the payment process.</li>
        <li><strong>Activation:</strong> Upon successful payment, you must follow the in-chat instructions (e.g., typing "ACTIVATE") to begin your 30-day premium access period.</li>
        <li><strong>Refund Policy:</strong> All payments are final and non-refundable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
    <p>You can terminate your use of the Service at any time by simply stopping your interaction with the bot or by requesting the deletion of your data.</p>

    <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We make no warranty that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free. While Easely is designed to be a reliable reminder tool, you agree that we are not liable for any damages, academic or otherwise, resulting from a missed or failed reminder. The ultimate responsibility for meeting deadlines rests with you.</p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall [Your Name/Project Name], nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will try to provide notice of any changes by posting the new Terms within the Service.</p>
