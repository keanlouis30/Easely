    <h1>Privacy Policy for Easely</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: August 26, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to Easely. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Easely chatbot on the Facebook Messenger platform (the "Service"). Please read this policy carefully.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information that is essential to provide and improve our Service.</p>
    
    <h3>A. Information Provided by Facebook Messenger:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Public Profile Information:</strong> Your first name, last name, and profile picture.</li>
        <li><strong>Messenger User ID:</strong> A unique, numeric ID assigned to you by Facebook, which we use to communicate with you and identify your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Information You Provide to Us:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Canvas Access Token:</strong> You explicitly provide us with your Canvas LMS Access Token. This is the key that allows our Service to connect to your Canvas account. We never store this token in plain text; it is always encrypted before being stored in our database.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Information We Access from Canvas (via your Token):</h3>
    <p>To provide our services, we use your token to access specific information from your Canvas account. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Assignments and Calendar Events:</strong> We access assignment titles, descriptions, due dates, and course information to provide reminders and populate your task list.</li>
        <li><strong>Course List:</strong> We access the names and IDs of your enrolled courses to allow you to add manual tasks to a specific course.</li>
        <li><strong>User Profile:</strong> We access your basic Canvas user ID to properly associate calendar events with your personal calendar.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not access or store your grades, your assignment submissions (unless explicitly requested for a feature like AI assistance), or personal files.</p>

    <h3>D. Information from Payment Processors:</h3>
    <p>When you subscribe to Easely Premium, you are redirected to a third-party payment processor (Ko-fi, which uses Stripe). We do not collect or see your credit card number, bank account details, or GCash information. We may receive a confirmation of payment from the processor, which may include your name, email address, and the subscription tier you purchased, which we use to activate your premium status.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide the Core Service:</strong> To sync your assignments, send you reminders, and allow you to manage tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>To Create and Manage Your Account:</strong> To link your Messenger ID with your Canvas data.</li>
        <li><strong>To Process Payments:</strong> To activate and manage your Easely Premium subscription.</li>
        <li><strong>To Communicate With You:</strong> To send you service-related messages, updates, and support responses.</li>
        <li><strong>To Provide AI-Powered Features:</strong> For features like "AI Outline Generation," the title and description of your assignment may be sent to a third-party AI service provider to generate a response. This data is not used to train their models.</li>
        <li><strong>To Improve Our Service:</strong> To monitor usage, identify issues, and develop new features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. We only share your information with the following third parties under limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Payment Processors (Ko-fi/Stripe):</strong> To securely process payments for premium subscriptions.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Service Providers (e.g., OpenAI):</strong> To provide specific AI-powered features as described above.</li>
        <li><strong>Law Enforcement:</strong> If required by law or in response to valid legal requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How We Protect Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Your Canvas Access Token is always encrypted at rest in our database.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Hosting:</strong> Our services are hosted on Render, which provides a secure, professional-grade infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Data Rights & Retention</h2>
    <p>You have control over your data.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access and Update:</strong> You can request to see the data we have stored about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion ("Clear My Data"):</strong> You can request the deletion of your account and all associated data at any time. This action will permanently remove your Canvas Token, task history, and user information from our systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We retain your information for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account or stop using the service, your data will be securely deleted from our active databases.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this policy.</p>
